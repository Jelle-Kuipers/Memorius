# Memorius
Ludicarum Bellorum Memorius is a warhammer 40,000 themed discord bot written in Python3.

It exists only to serve and aid in the planning of our next date of wargaming or dnd.
The bot is heavily stylized after warhammer 40,000 and it's name is a rough High-Gothic translation of "reminder of wargames" (as by ChatGPT)
